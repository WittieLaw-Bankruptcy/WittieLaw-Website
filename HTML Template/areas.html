                  <div class=""> <blockquote> A Texas native, I grew up in Waco and came to Houston after high school. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Rice University in 1979. I also studied as an undergraduate at the University of Houston. I continued my love affair with all things Houston by attending and achieving my juris doctorate (JD) in 1983 from the University of Houston College of Law.
I served as a clerk for the disbanded firm of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay, one of the first bankruptcy boutique firms in Houston. My first position in 1984 as a baby lawyer (the term for first-year inexperienced associates) was with another bankruptcy boutique, the disbanded firm of Cowgill & Emmott, P.C.
Bankruptcy law is what I do.</blockquote>

              What has kept me interested in bankruptcy law has been the ability to help people resolve problems and move forward with their lives. It’s also been a tool for small business owners to either get leaner and more successful to move forward, or to close their doors and make final communication to creditors in an orderly fashion. I like helping people make order out of financial chaos.
I am licensed to practice in the State of Texas and before the U.S. District Courts and Bankruptcy Courts for the Southern District of Texas. 
Contact me at 713-226-2321. There is no charge for the initial consultation. If you hire me, the time of the initial consultation will be applied to the fee.</div>
