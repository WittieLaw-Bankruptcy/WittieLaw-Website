General Information:
</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">The Bankruptcy Code provides for six types of bankruptcy cases that are traditionally named for the chapters in the Bankruptcy Code that describes them. Three of these chapters are discussed below in more detail because they are the chapters most known by consumers and small businesses. The Wittie Law Firm provides assistance to clients with cases falling under Chapters 7, 11 and 13.
 </p>
 <div id="Ch7">
              <h6>Chapter 7</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Chapter 7 is liquidation, or “straight bankruptcy.” It contemplates an orderly, court-supervised procedure as a trustee takes over the assets of the debtor’s estate and sells them to create cash to distribute to creditors in an equitable fashion. Unsecured creditors, those without a lien on any specific property of the debtor, only receive payment from the liquidated property of the debtor’s bankruptcy estate. This right of the trustee to take assets is subject to the debtor’s right to retain certain exempt property, the rights of secured creditors to retain their lien rights, and the costs associated with the sale of some assets. There are two sets of law that cover exemptions and exempt property in Texas. Once you list all your property, as required by the Bankruptcy Code, you must select which law you wish to use to cover your property and to protect it from liquidation. Because most consumer cases contain little or no property that is not exempt or burdensome to sell, there may not be an actual liquidation of assets. These are the “no-asset cases” that leave all assets in the hands of the debtor. The unsecured creditors receive no payment on their debts. The debtor, if the debtor is an individual, receives a discharge that relieves them from any personal liability on the debts. In 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act began requiring the application of a “means test” to determine whether a consumer debtor qualified for relief under Chapter 7. If the debtor exceeds certain income levels, the debtor may not be eligible for Chapter 7 but may be eligible for other relief.
Meet with The Wittie Law Firm or another qualified bankruptcy attorney to determine your eligibility. To prepare, collect your income verification for the past two calendar years by finding your last two filed federal income tax returns and the past six months of income or wage statements, such as your paycheck stubs or other proof of earnings. Special circumstances control retired workers and the self-employed. At an initial consult, The Wittie Law Firm will tell you what information is required by the court.

  <div id="Ch11">
              <h6>Chapter 11</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Chapter 11 is larger, more complicated than the readjustment of debts in a Chapter 13 and usually operates without the benefit of a trustee. The debtor and the attorney for the debtor perform the duties handled by the Chapter 13 trustee. This includes the scheduling and payment of claims in the proposed plan. Chapter 11 is used by businesses and individuals who operate commercial enterprises who want to remain in operation and pay creditors from an ongoing enterprise through a court-approved plan of reorganization. Unless creditors contest it or the court rules otherwise, the debtor has the exclusive right to propose a plan of reorganization for the first 120 days after the case is filed. The debtor must provide its creditors with a disclosure statement that submits a review the plan of reorganization in enough detail for creditors to evaluate the plan. The court will approve the plan at the confirmation hearing if the disclosure was adequate, creditors approve, and the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met. Under the confirmed plan, creditors can have their debts reduced or discharged entirely. Leases can be terminated. Payments or assets transferred by the debtor may be taken back. The debtor can show evidence that it can be a profitable enterprise by reforming its operations and remain in the marketplace.
Undertaking a Chapter 11 requires an examination of records and determination of the rights and responsibilities of the debtor and its creditors over a period of time. Be prepared when contemplating a Chapter 11 for a business by having your record-keeping in good order and ready for your bankruptcy professional.

  <div id="Ch13">
              <h6>Chapter 13</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Chapter 13 is named “Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income.” It is for an individual debtor who has regular income. People choose Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 when they are proposing to keep a valuable asset like the family home and they propose a “plan” that repays creditors over a 3- to 5-year period. When potential debtors do not qualify for Chapter 7 under the means test, they use Chapter 13 to stop creditor collections and harassment. Chapter 13 is very different from Chapter 7 in the role of the case trustee. In Chapter 13, the debtor remains in possession of all property of the estate. The Chapter 13 trustee administers the payments made by the debtor and makes the payments over a period of time that can range from 36 to 60 months under the proposed plan once it has been approved by, or “confirmed,” by the bankruptcy court. The plan is confirmed by the court at a hearing held for this purpose if it meets the Bankruptcy Code requirements for confirmation. While in the Chapter 13, the debtor is protected from lawsuits, garnishments, and creditor contact. When the plan is complete and all the requirements of Chapter 13 are met, the debtor receives a discharge.</p>
              <h6>FOR ALL BANKRUPTCY CHAPTERS:</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Bankruptcy in the United States is governed under the United States Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4). Congress established federal bankruptcy laws to give the debtor a “fresh start” from the burden of unresolved debt. In the words of the Supreme Court, it is the honest but unfortunate debtor who is given a new opportunity in life. There are responsibilities and duties for the honest debtor, and finding competent assistance from a good bankruptcy lawyer is the first step to new life.
