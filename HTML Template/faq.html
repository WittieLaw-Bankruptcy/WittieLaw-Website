              <h3 class="p0">Bankruptcy-Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
              <h6>1.  What is bankruptcy?</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Bankruptcy is federal law that gives people and businesses that owe money they cannot pay (debtors) protection of the law while treating those who are owed the money (creditors) in a fair fashion compared to all other creditors of the same type of debt. There are six different kinds, or “chapters” of bankruptcy, but three are the most important.  </p>
                <div class="indent-left">
              <h6>Chapter 7</h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">Liquidation is available to a debtor who, after calculating the reasonable monthly expenses for the debtor’s household, has no income left for paying debt. In Chapter 7, an order forgiving debt is issued for most debts after all the requirements of filing Chapter 7 are met. If the debtor has any property not protected by exemption law, it is liquidated by a Chapter 7 trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court. This liquidated asset fund is all the money that may be available for payment to unsecured creditors in the Chapter 7 case. There are no other funds or money paid to the creditors, but the debtor is forgiven the entire debt upon receiving the discharge.</p>
              <h6>Chapter 11 </h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">is a repayment plan or reorganization. It is provided for smaller cases and large businesses. There are debt limitations, but most consumers qualify for a Chapter 13 repayment plan that has many preferred benefits for consumers and small businesses. Large business problems are usually restructured in a Chapter 11.</p>

              <h6>Chapter 13 </h6>
              <p class="img-indent-bot">is a way that various types of debt are restructured and paid over as many as 60 months. A discharge is only received after some debt is repaid.</p>
              </div>
       <p></p>
              <h6>2.  Why do it?</h6>
             You get relief from creditors. You get to keep your primary residence, your car and you are able to get time to return to financial normalcy. You can recover from financial nightmares.
<p></p>
             <h6>3. What is a bankruptcy discharge?</h6> 
Federal bankruptcy law releases a debtor from the personal liability for certain debts after the requirements of the chapter filed, or type of case, are met. This release of personal liability for debt is called the “discharge,” and after it is issued, the person no longer is obligated to pay the debt that has been discharged. Surrendering collateral outside of bankruptcy does not eliminate your personal responsibility for paying the debt and you can end up being sued for a deficiency. Bankruptcy eliminates the deficiency lawsuit because you have no further liability to the creditor. If you wish to keep an asset that has a debt owed to a secured creditor, in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy you may “reaffirm” the debt. This reaffirmation agreement is an agreement entered into in writing that survives the bankruptcy filing that allows you to keep the asset based upon an arrangement with the creditor. This must be entered into before the close of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case or the debt will be discharged.
<p></p>
<h6>4.  What debts survive a bankruptcy discharge?</h6>
Non-dischargeable debts include, in most cases:



 <div class="indent-left">
  <ul>
    <li>Alimony</li>
  <li>Child Support</li>
  <li>Recent unpaid taxes</li>
  <li>Student loans</li>
  <li>Debts for large purchases close to a bankruptcy filing</li>
  <li>Cash advances on credit cards or lines of credit close to a bankruptcy filing</li>
  <li>Fines or penalties to governmental agencies</li>
  <li>Fraudulent debts</li>
</ul>
</div>
Although non-dischargeable, many of these types of debts can be restructured in a Chapter 13 case and paid out over a period up to 60 months.

<p></p>

<h6>5.  Will filing bankruptcy stop the creditor from harassing you?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
Yes! Bankruptcy provides you with a protective order from the bankruptcy court immediately upon filing your case. Upon qualifying and filing the case, acquiring a case number, and giving notice to creditors, harassment should stop. If it continues, there is help available in bankruptcy court and through federal law to stop creditor harassment.
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>6.  Will I ever have a good credit rating after bankruptcy?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
  Yes, you can achieve credit scores that make you a worthy customer again. Paying your after-bankruptcy debts on time and watching for the proper mix of credit-to-income in your record is key. Bankruptcy is reported for certain periods of time -- seven years for Chapter 13 and 10 years for Chapter 7. You can begin re-building your credit upon your discharge or at the end of the bankruptcy case. 
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>7.  Must I use a lawyer to file for bankruptcy?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
No. You may represent yourself. You are held to the same standard as a qualified bankruptcy lawyer and will have to meet document standards and deadlines as if you are already familiar with the law. Under the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, the paperwork requirements are burdensome and the deadlines are short. You are taking tremendous risk if you represent yourself which is called proceeding as a Pro Se debtor. There is no one at the court that can give you legal advice. You are on your own. If you do things improperly, you can lose assets, your discharge of debts could be denied, and in extreme cases, you could face federal criminal charges. Few Pro Se filers have been successful in completing their cases.
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>8.  Can filing bankruptcy stop a foreclosure?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
Yes. Filing Chapter 7 will stop the foreclosure sale for the date set for the sale to take place, but the delay may only be for a month or two. You must become current on your mortgage in a short amount of time for Chapter 7 to stop a foreclosure sale from being re-posted. Filing for Chapter 13 relief will allow you to pay your mortgage arrears over a period of up to 60 months, putting you back in current status on your mortgage after you make all of the payments required under Chapter 13. Exceptions to stopping foreclosure happen if you have filed for bankruptcy multiple times and the mortgage creditor has gotten protection from the bankruptcy court so that they may proceed with the foreclosure sale. Only the honest debtor gets the protection of the bankruptcy court.
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>9.  Does filing bankruptcy mean I don’t have to pay for my house or car?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
No. Creditors who have protected their loan by taking a lien on property are called “secured creditors” and have a right to take property that does not have the lien serviced or “paid”. Filing for Chapter 7 means you may have the right to redeem property, that is, pay its full value and get the lien released. You can continue to make payments on your house and car and keep them under the terms of the contract. If you do not do either of these things to address the secured creditor’s lien rights, they can take the house back by foreclosure or repossess the car, motorcycle or RV. Outside of bankruptcy, you can even owe money for property foreclosed or repossessed if its value was less than what you owed. With the benefit of bankruptcy, you can get a discharge of any lingering indebtedness. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, most secured debts can be repaid over the 60 months of the plan. 
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>10. How can I pay a bankruptcy lawyer if I can’t pay my bills?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
The court supervises and regulates charges and fees. A Chapter 7 case will usually cost around $2,000. A consumer Chapter 13 has a fixed fee of $3,500, with business cases being higher. Business cases and those with litigation can be more expensive, but far less than litigation in state or federal court outside of bankruptcy. Hiring a competent, experienced bankruptcy attorney has been regulated by the bankruptcy court. Consumer bankruptcy cases are some of the least expensive cases handled by experienced counsel. An experienced attorney will tell you what your case will cost. Initial consultations are usually at no charge.
</div>
<p></p>
<h6>11. Must I close my business and sell off all my assets if I file for bankruptcy?</h6>
<div class="indent-left">
No. You may continue in most situations to continue to operate a business. Picking the type of case that will give you the most relief and keep you in business is done on a case-by-case basis. You have many options. If you see trouble on the horizon, schedule an appointment with an experienced attorney. Restructuring debt may be an option that keeps you in business. There may be other options for retaining assets and getting a new beginning for your business.
